1. What is printed by line 9? If the code returns an error, explain why.
As long as the input add is a boolean true, and all other inputs are the expected data type, line 9 will print the text "values added: " followed by the value of result, which will is computed in line 7 by adding num1 and num2
2. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why. 
if our input add was a boolean true, line 13 will print the text "final result: " followed by the value of result, otherwise we will get an error. This is because if add is not boolean true we will never enter the if statement and therefore never declare the var result, trying to print the value of an undeclared variable gives an error in javascript.
